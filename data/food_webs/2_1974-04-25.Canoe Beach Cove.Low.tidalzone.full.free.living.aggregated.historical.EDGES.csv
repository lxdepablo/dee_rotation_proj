In cases such as that of W. mucosa in the littoral zone, phenolic concentrations are linked to decreased herbivory (Higgins et al. 2015). Despite this, some indirect evidence showing increased grazing of H. maura transplanted to the lower littoral zone suggests some preference by littorinids, but further evidence is needed for confirmation (Higgins et al. 2015).""","","","Vali","intertidal","mid","","Bay of Fundy","Nova Scotia","no","","","2019","","","Vail","2021","10.1656/045.028.0306","no","",""
